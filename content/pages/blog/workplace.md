According to WHO (World Health Organization):

"Burn-out is a syndrome conceptualized as resulting from chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed. It is characterized by three dimensions:

*   feelings of energy depletion or exhaustion;

*   increased mental distance from one’s job, or feelings of negativism or cynicism related to one's job; and

*   reduced professional efficacy.

Burn-out refers specifically to phenomena in the occupational context and should not be applied to describe experiences in other areas of life."
